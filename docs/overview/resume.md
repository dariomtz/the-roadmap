# Resume

Building a resume is the most important step towards clearing the first filter
in the job application process: Getting an interview. 

## Format

The resume should **always** be one page only in a PDF file - no exceptions. The
person reviewing your resume will only spend a few seconds looking at it. You 
need to make sure the relevant information is visible and easy to find.

The following is a description of the sections you must include in your resume.

### Contact Information

You want to make sure that in one line or two you can provide the following
information:

- Full Name
- Email
- Phone Number - Do not forget country code if you are applying to a different
  country.
- Relevant links: portfolio, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.

!!! warning
    Do not provide pictures, age, or address. Those personal details are
    not relevant and they are usually a waste of space. Some companies might even
    discard your resume if you include them for legal reasons.

### Education

List your education in reverse chronological order - meaining the most recent
education first. Include the following information:

- Name of the institution
- Name of the degree and type of degree (B.S., M.S., etc.)
- Graduation date. For internship positions, include the expected graduation date.
- GPA - Mandatory. Does not matter how low it is, it can always be lower. If you
  do not include it, the recruiter will assume it is low.

!!! note 
    If your experience is more relevant than your education, you can switch the
    order of these sections.
    Generally speaking, if you are applying for internships or junior positions,
    your education should go first.

### Experience 

List your experience in reverse chronological order - meaning the most recent
experience first. Include the following information:

- Name of the company
- Name of the position
- Dates of employment
- A brief description of your responsibilities and achievements
    - Use one line for the job description, team, technologies, tools, programming
    languages.
    - Use bullet points to list achievements and deliverables.
    - Use bold for programming languages and tools.

!!! warning
    Do not include any information that is confidential or proprietary.

### Projects

List your projects in relevance order - meaning the most relevant projects first.
Include the following information:

- Name of the project.
- Weather it was an academic or extracurricular project.
- Dates of the project.
- A brief description of the project.
    - Use one line for the project description, team, technologies, tools, programming
    languages.
    - Use bullet points to list achievements and deliverables.
    - Use bold for programming languages and tools.

### Skills

This section is enterely optional. When you list your projects and experience, 
you should already be listing the skills you have. However, if you have any
other skills that are relevant to the job you are applying for, you can list them
here in **just one line**. Using too much space on this section means that you
did not properly convey your experience with your projects/experience.

### Extracurriculars and Awards 

This section is also optional. If you have any relevant extracurricular activities
like:

- Hackathons or other competitions
- Clubs
- Volunteering
- Awards
    - Academic
    - Professional
    - Extracurricular

!!! note
    There is a misconception that you "need" to have certifications under your 
    belt to get a job. This is not true. If you happen to have certifications, 
    describing a project/experience that shows the skill is better than listing
    the certification on its own.

### Formatting tips

If you have trouble fitting all the information in one page, consider the
following tips:

- Use a font size of 10-12
- Reduce the margins to fit more information
- Use bullet points to list information
- Use bold and italics to highlight important information
- Use a consistent format for dates and titles
- Use tables and columns to fit more information
- Use a font type that is slim. For example, Calibri can fit more words in a
line than Arial.
- Use the full line width to explain your experience and projects. Using less or
just a little more than the line will result in a lot of wasted space.
