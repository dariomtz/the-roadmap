# The Technical Interview

As mentioned in [the interview guide](interviews.md), techincal interviews are hands on problem
solving interviews where you need to show you knowledge about computer science
while at the same time communicating your approach to the interviewer.

## The Format

Most technical interviews take from 45 minutes to an hour, where:

* The first 5 minutes are to get to know the interviewer, and share some of your
past experience
* Then you jump into the problem for 35-40 minutes depending on the lenght of
the interview
* At the end, the last 5 minutes are for you to ask questions to the interviewer

Even though the techincal problem requires more time and preparation, the first
and last part of the interview are still very important.

## The Introduction

There is only one first impresion, and making sure you make the most out of it 
is essential to start the interview with the right foot. Make sure you prepare 
an intro for yourself that includes:

* Your name.
* Your experience and relevant background
* Your latest project or what you are currently working on.

!!! failure "Bad example"
    "Hi, my name is Dario and I am X years old. I am majoring in computer
    science and love to solve problems"

    This introduction has background that is not relevant. It also includes
    too little background on what is really relevant and does not clarify your 
    experience.

    For students:
    "Hi, my name is Dario and I am a bachelor's student majoring in computer
    systems next Fall. I am currently taking a course about cloud where I had to
    work ona web app that leverages AWS as it's infrastructure using products
    like EC2 and DynamoDB."
    
    For profesionals:
    "Hi, my name is Dario and I have been working as a software engineer for
    four years. I started as a front-end engineer but was curious about 
    exploring other areas, which is why as of recently I have been working in
    infrastructure.
    In my current job, we handle the pipelines for analytics events, which have
    major traffic and are composed of various services and components. We make
    use of open source technologies within our pipelines, such as Apache
    products like spark and airflow, as well as standar AWS products, such as
    Kinesis and DynamoDB."

## The Experience Interview

As mentioned in the [general interview
guide](interviews.md#experience-interviews), these interviews can be embeded at
the beginning of a technical interview. Being able to share your previous
experience could help your interviewer guage your level of communication and
ability to contribute to a larger organization. For this section, you can
prepare by:

* Making sure you can answer questions about your projects in the resume
* Prepare one project or instance where you can clearly state impact and other
important attributes such as collaboration and project excecution.
* Prepare one project that was a learning experience and point out what you 
did to fix the issues you faced.

## Questions to the Interviewer

At the end of the interview, you would usually have 5 minutes to ask questions
to the engineer about the company and their experience in it. Make sure you 
avoid asking oddly specific questions. Most engineers work within their circle
to build the products their team owns, and asking about specific things you have
heard or rumors you heard on the internet is usually a waste of time. As a rule
of thumb, do not ask anything you can find the answer to by Googling.

Instead, ask personal questions where you can learn about their perspective of
the company and what it is like to work there. Some examples of good questions
are:

* What is something that excites you about the company?
* Why did you decide to join or even apply to the company to begin with?
* What is your favorite thing about the company?
* How does your day look like? 
* What are some exciting challenges you face in you day to day work?

## The Technical Question

As mentioned before, the rest of the guide is dedicated to sharing how to solve
such technical challenges. However, the porpuse of this section is to acclimate
you to what the challenge will look like. 

Most companies will provide a live sharing web editor where the question will be
pasted or explained. Most of the times, these editor will not have any fancy
features other than maybe coloring your text for syntax. 

During this almost hour block, you are expected to:

1. Understand the question
2. Propose a solution
3. Code the solution
4. Test the solution

All of these things should be done while also communicating every step of your
process to the interviewer, so they can asses your communication skills.

There are two major things to prepare for this section of the interview, and
each one deserves its own guide.

* Format of the interview: How to problem solve and communicate effectively.
* Computer science topics: what the actual questions will be about.

A great book that covers everything mentioned in this roadmap, explaining how
to prepare for each section of the interview and even providing problems on the
relevant computer science topics.
