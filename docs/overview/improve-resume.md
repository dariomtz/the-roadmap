# Improve Resume

After reviewing the previous guide on [how to build a resume](resume.md), you 
are left with a good page that outlines your skills and experiences. However, 
turning your resume from good to great depends on how you present your 
projects and experiences. This guide will help you do exactly that.

## General Tips

### Start With Action Verbs

Every sentence has to clearly state what you did. Use action verbs to start
**all** your sentences. Examples of action verbs are:

- Developed
- Created
- Implemented
- Designed
- Managed
- Led
- Built
- Worked
- Founded
- Used
- Helped
- Volunteer
- Contributed
- Researched

### Description

Use a description to clarify your role in the position/project in as much 
detail as you can using **only one line**.

Include the following information:

- Name of the team (for work experiences) or subject (for academic projects)
- Name of technologies and tools used.
- Description of the teams responsibilities / scope of the project.

!!! failure "Bad example"

    **Software Engineer - Google**                                   2018 - 2020

    Worked on Google's search engine 

!!! success "Good example"

    **Software Engineer - Google**                                   2018 - 2020

    Worked on infrastructure and backend services for Google's search engine 
    using **Python**, **C++**, and **Java**.

### Bullet Points

On the [resume guide](resume.md), there is an instruction to list your 
achievements and deliverables in bullet points. However, selling your experience
is not just about listing what you did. It is about listing what, how and why 
you did it. 

Usually, we only state the "what" and the "how" part.

!!! failure "Bad example"
    - Developed a website using React.js

!!! warning "Not so bad example"
    - Developed a website to watch YouTube videos with friends.

The X-Y-Z formula is a good way to structure your bullet points. It goes like 
this:

"Accomplished X, as measured by Y, by doing Z."

- X: The impact that your project had.
- Y: How you measured the impact. It does not have to be a metric - but it 
    could be.
- Z: How you did it.

!!! success "Good example"
    - Built a feature that allows users to watch YouTube videos syncronized
    with friends using web sockets

Good companies are impact driven. Therefore, presenting how your work helped
the company, or what your project enabled users to do is better than just
stating what you did.

### Example for Projects

Applying for internships or junior full time jobs is hard because as a student, 
you rarely have profesional experience to showcase. However, academic and
extracurricular projects also count as experience.

!!! failure "Bad example"

    **Netflix Clone - Academic Project**                                   2020

    Web application for watching movies and tv shows.

    - Developed a website using **React.js** and **Javascript**.

!!! warning "Example without impact"

    **Netflix Clone - Academic Project**                                   2020

    Built a web application of a content service for movies and tv shows using
    **React.js** and **JavaScript**.

    - Developed the backend using **Node.js** and **Express.js**.
    - Implemented an admin site to manage movies.

!!! success "Good example"
    
    **Netflix Clone - Academic Project**                                   2020

    Built a web application of a content service for movies and tv shows using 
    **React.js** and **JavaScript**.

    - Built a rest API using **Node.js** and express.js to manage movies, users,
    authentication, and authorization.
    - Implemented a web app to add, update, and delete the movies and shows that
    appear on the main website.

### Intern Project

After completing your first internship, this is the most important work
experience you will have in your resume. However, since you are still a student,
keep your education on top of everything still. 

Since you likely signed and NDA in order to work at the company, you can't share
every detail. However, you can still share:

- Industry standard tools and technologies you used - programming languages,
open source technologies.
- Industry standard practices you followed - collecting metrics, building 
dashboards, following a UI design, writing tech specs, etc.
- The impact of your work - as long as it does not contain an unnanounced
feature.

Then, you can use the same structure as a regular project. Again, just be
careful of disclosing non-public information.

### Work Experience

Work experience is a little different, since rather than sharing a particular
project, you want to make sure you share your responsibilities. This is going
to change as you go up the ladder of Software Engineering levels, because
your scope of responsibilities should grow with you. This is out of scope for 
this particular guide.
