# Interviews

The interview process is the second step in the hiring process. Once your 
[resume](resume.md) has been reviewed and you have been selected for an 
interview, you will be contacted to schedule interviews.

The interview processes for technical positions includes technical interviews.
Many of such interviews require computer science knowledge, coding skills, and
problem-solving abilities.

## Types of Interviews

### The "Trivia" Interviews
Lots of small or medium size companies will do "trivia" interviews. That is 
where you get questions about computer science or sotfware engineering topics
that do not require problem solving skills.

Some big companies use these types of questions as warm up before technical
interviews. You should not be worried about these types of questions, as 
they only have one answer and they should be easy to answer if you have heard
the question before.

Common examples of trivia questions are:

* What are the pillars of Object Oriented Programming?
    * Follow up: What is a particular pillar?
    * Example: What is encapsulation/polymorphism?
* What is the difference between two data structures?
    * Example: What is the difference between a list and an array?

### Assigment Interviews

Assigment intervies are exactly what they sound like: you take home a mini 
project and demonstrate your skill through being able to follow the 
requirements.

### Experience Interviews

During an experience interview, you are presented with questions that will help
frame what you have worked on in the past so that the company can level you up
appropriately. This interview could be embeded to the technical interview
(mentioned bellow) for internships and new grad positions. However, for most
full time position this will take its own hour or 45 minute block.

### Technical Interviews

The technical interview is the most common type of interview in tech companies.
It is like the secret handshake of software engineering. The interview consist
of a 1 hour or 45 minute call where the candidate solves a problem via coding. 

There is a lot of prep required to do great at technical interviews, including 
but not limited to: data structures, algorithms, communication, requirement
clarification, testing, etc.

Most of the content on this roadmap is related to the technical interview, due
to the amount of topics needed to be fully prepared for it.

!!! Note
    Not all companies ask technical interviews, but usually the ones that offer
    better benefits and career opportunities do. Even if the job is the same, 
    being able to solve technical interviews can open bigger doors for you.

### Architecture Interviews

Architecture or Design interviews are common for positions that require some 
experience. These usually involve problem solving by planning a pipeline or the
infrastructure of a particular feature.

!!! info
    As of now, I have no intention of building a guide for design interviews.
