# Interview Preparation

## Solve Problems Effectively

During the technical interview, you will be presented with a problem. There are
many diffent solutions that might work it. However, in order to be able to
arrive to a desired solution, you need to follow a process that will help you
narrow down the best way to solve it. 

That is why I encourage interviewees to follow these steps:

1. Understand the problem
2. Think of options
3. Walk through the desired option
4. Code
5. Test

You will notice that the coding portion is really the 4th step. There are many
things that need to happen before you jump into coding your solution.

### 1 Understand the Problem

There are many things you can do to be able to fully understand the problem. 
Mainly, this portion of the interview is for you to get the requirements so that
you can start thinking of how you want to solve this. There are a lot of
problems where the question itself does not pose the requirements and one little
change in the input or expected output can require a whole different solution.

So, you want to make sure that the problem that you read and the problem that is
presented by the interviewer is the same. 

Therefore, you need to **ask questions**: Make sure you understand inputs,
outputs, and its data types. Requirements such as order, format, constraints,
etc are crutial to understand the question properly.

During this phase, the best thing you can do is **ask for an example**. It can
allow you to see what your solution is supposed to do. 

However, do not trust the example 100%, since a lot of companies give tricky
examples in order to make sure you clarify assumptions about the example. Does 
the example contain spaces? Uppercase? special characters? The example is in
order; are all the inputs expected to be?

### 2 Think of Options

Once you have a clear picture, you can start thinking of ways to solve the
problem. In order to do that, start with the simplest solution possible:
**brute force**. Stating outloud that you know what a brute force solution
would look like lets the interviewer know you have the basics figured out. 

!!! warning
    Avoid optimizing silently. As mentioned before, stating low performance or 
    brute force solutions outloud helps your interviewer know what you know. 
    If you are silently optimizing, they might not even know that you have
    already thought of the basic ways of solving the problem. 

Now that you have stated the obvious, you can start stating forward steps. Your
interviewer should guide you through the process of choosing the right
approach, letting you know when you need to optimize further or when you need
to stop optimizing and your approach is good.

This is when you think of data structures or algorithms you know, and how can they
help you solve the problem more efficiently.

### 3 Walk Through the Algorithm

Once you have arrived to an idea that makes sense for the problem, you are still
not going to jump into the code. 

I highly encourage to walk through an example with your proposed algorithm and 
write down anything that might be complex to figure out on the fly:
what are your key conditions in the algorithm? What are some edge cases that
you need to handle?

Walking through those would also get rid of assumptions humans make when
solving problems. For example, there are some algorithms that seem simple when
explaining them but that require an extra condition or extra formula to be
solved properly. Having those formulas or conditions in advance can help you 
smoothly code the solution.

### 4 Code

Everything is clear as water: The problem, the approach, the complexity, the
details. Now you can just do it.

For this section it is important to note that practice makes perfect. Many
candidates I have interviewed over the years can easiliy get to this point and
then struggle with basic syntax and semantics of the programming language
chosen. 

The point of letting you choose the language is so that you can interview in
the one that you feel most comfortable. However, even if you are comfortable
with the language and you use it on a daily basis, you need to practice
interviewing with it before the real interview.

That is why you must practice with platforms that do not have all the tools
that you are used to having, such as LSP's, AI completers, etc.

Using a simple editor will help you notice which API's and language features
you are not enterely proficient with. At the beginning, you wil find that you
may need to search a lot of basic things. Over time, you will be able to fully
solve problems without consulting anything about the language or its libraries.

### 5 Test

Make sure your code works. Run your code as if you were the computer, keeping
track of what is in memory in writing and modifying such memory step by step.

This technique allows you to catch bugs and typos you might have made when
writing your code.

## Communicate Effectivelly

During the interview, it is crucial to keep communicating what you are thinking
about the problem and how to go about solving it. Every step of the way, your
intervierwer must know what is on your head. If so, they can give appropriate
hints and interrupt when you are not on the rigth track.

To practice communication (specially if english is not your first language)
schedule mock interviews with friends and peers so that you get to practice
your communication within the interview. 

In my opinion, it is not enough to solve problems and talk to yourself to be
able to overcome this barrier. Talking to a different human being might be
nerverecking the first interview, but since you have done it multiple times for 
mock interviews, the real interview will be easier.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

In order for you to know how to propose solutions, optimize, code, and test it
is necessary that you know the computer science topics like complexity
analysis, data structures and algorithms.

That is why the next section of this guide is [data
structures](../../data-structures/overview), where I cover the basics. After
that, you can jump into the [algorithms section](../../algorithms/overview), where
you can find the next steps on mastering technical interviews.
