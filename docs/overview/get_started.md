# Get Started

## Setting expectations

Although this guide is from zero to hero - meaning you can start from nothing
and get to the point of obtaining a full time job, it is important to set up 
expectations.

Personally, it took me four years to get my first internship, and five years to
get a full time job.

I hope you can use my experience to accomplish in **less than a year** what I was
able to accomplish over the course of five years. Meaning it will probably take
you months to become a world class Software Engineer; and that is fine.

This is not a crash course. Just as any other profession, it requires time and
dedication. Hopefully, reading this roadmap can be the start of a new chapter
in your professional life.

## Learn the basics

Learning the basics of programming is necessary to become a Software Engineer.
Luckily, there are many great resources to accomplish that. The following steps
are my recommendation on how to begin your learning journey.

* Choose ONE programming language: Any programming language is fine, as long
as you stick to it. My recommendations are:
    * Python
    * Go
    * Java
    * C/C++
    * JavaScript
!!! note
    There are many other programming languages you can use, but these are the 
    ones that I personally recommend. 

* Follow a guide to set up your development environment for the language chosen.
There is no need to go too far with it, as long as you can make a "Hello World"
program.

* Follow a beginners course to learn the basics. Make sure you understand:
    * Standard input and output.
    * Data types
        * Integers.
        * Floating point numbers.
        * Characters and strings of characters.
        * Boolean: true or false values.
    * Variables
    * Flow control:
        * If, else, else if
        * For loops, while loops

!!! note
    I am planning to build a guide to also cover this section. As of now, 
    follow a FREE beginners course from any website, and search your questions
    online

After learning these concepts, you can build many, many things already.

## Getting a Job

To get a job as a Software Engineer, there are two main filters:

1. Getting an interview
2. Passing the interview

### How to get an interview?

In order to get an interview you must first build a resume. That will be your 
presentation card for the companies you intend to apply for. 

However, to build a resume you must have experiences you intend to showcase.
It is not necessary that those are industry or work related, specially if you
are starting out in your programming journey. Academic and extracurricular
projects can be a great way of showing what you can do, your interests, and your initiative.

Details on this are covered in the [resume building](resume.md) section.

### How to pass the interview?

While you work on your projects, it is important that you get ready for the
interview process. That means learning the technical topics, and format of the
interviews. This requires digging deep into computer science topics, such as
data structures and algorithms. As for the format, practicing with friends via
mock interviews is a great way to get used to them and learn how to get better 
at them.

Details on this are covered in the [Interview Prep](interviews.md) section.
